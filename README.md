Project 1 - Game Description: We intend to develop an application that, when initialized, asks the user to choose the game's difficulty level and then randomly generates and presents a calculation so that we can inform the result.

We will limit transactions to adding, subtracting and multiplying. If the user gets the answer right, 1 point will be added to their score.

Project 2 - Market Description: We intend to develop an application that, when initialized, presents the user with a menu where they can register, list and buy products, in addition to viewing the shopping cart or exiting the application. When adding a product to the shopping cart, you must check if there is already the same product in the cart, and simply change the quantity. When finalizing the purchase, the user must be presented with the total according to the products and additional items added to the shopping cart.

Project 3 - Bank Description: We intend to develop an application that, when initialized, asks the user to choose what they want to do at the bank, such as creating an account, making a withdrawal, making a deposit, making a transfer, listing accounts or exiting the system.
